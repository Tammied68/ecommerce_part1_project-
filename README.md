# eCommerce Application Part 1

## Overview

This project is a Django-based eCommerce application developed as part of the HyperionDev Software Engineering Bootcamp.

The application supports two user roles:

- **Buyers** who can browse products, add items to a shopping cart, complete purchases, and leave reviews.
- **Vendors** who can create stores and manage products within those stores.

The system implements role-based access control, session-based shopping carts, checkout functionality, invoice generation, email notifications, password recovery, and verified purchase reviews.

---

## Features

### Authentication

The application includes:

- User registration
- User login
- User logout
- Password reset and account recovery
- Role-based access control
- Automatic buyer/vendor group assignment during registration

Users are automatically assigned to the appropriate Django group when registering, allowing immediate access to role-specific functionality without requiring administrative intervention.

---

### Vendor Features

Vendors can:

- Create stores
- Edit stores
- Delete stores
- View stores they own
- Add products to stores
- Edit products
- Delete products
- View customer reviews on products

Vendor-only functionality is protected through role-based permissions.

---

### Buyer Features

Buyers can:

- Browse available products
- View product details
- Add products to a shopping cart
- Checkout purchases
- Leave product reviews
- View verified purchase indicators

---

### Shopping Cart

The application uses Django sessions to maintain cart contents while users browse the store.

Features include:

- Add products to cart
- View cart contents
- View order totals
- Checkout purchased items
- Automatic cart clearing after successful checkout

---

### Checkout and Invoicing

When a buyer completes checkout:

- An order is created
- Order items are recorded
- Products are removed from the cart
- An invoice is generated
- An invoice email is sent to the buyer

---

### Product Reviews

Buyers can leave reviews on products.

The application automatically determines whether a user has previously purchased a product and displays:

- **Verified Purchase**
- **Unverified**

This provides more trustworthy feedback for future buyers.

---

### Account Recovery

The application implements Django's built-in password reset functionality.

Features include:

- Password reset request by email
- Secure password reset tokens
- Password reset confirmation page
- Password reset completion page

During development, password reset emails are displayed in the terminal using Django's Console Email Backend.
